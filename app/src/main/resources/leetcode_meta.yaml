  link: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-array-equal/
  hint: >
      for nums[i] and nums[j], the number of operations to make them equal is j-i ( ((2*j+1)-(2*i+1))/2 ). 
      Based on the observation, we can come up with a 2-pointers O(n) solution by adding up all operation counts until i==j.
      To make it better, we can observe the operation counts in the loop. They are arithmetic sequence [0/1, 3, 5, 7,...,n-1].
      Note the first number should be either 0 (if n is odd, the middle number doesn't change) or 1 (if n is even).

        First this is a tree, not a graph, so each edge can break it into 2 subtrees. Then we think about the relations between the 2 connected subtrees. 
        We can come up with the formula: distances[x] = x@X + y@Y + #(Y), where X,Y are the two subtrees, and x,y are the root for X and Y. #(Y) is the total number of nodes in subtree Y.
        Then we can further calculate the # of children for each node, and the total path sum for root, and break down into each sub-level children from root.
