  link: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-array-equal/
  hint: >
      for nums[i] and nums[j], the number of operations to make them equal is j-i ( ((2*j+1)-(2*i+1))/2 ). 
      Based on the observation, we can come up with a 2-pointers O(n) solution by adding up all operation counts until i==j.
      To make it better, we can observe the operation counts in the loop. They are arithmetic sequence [0/1, 3, 5, 7,...,n-1].
      Note the first number should be either 0 (if n is odd, the middle number doesn't change) or 1 (if n is even).
