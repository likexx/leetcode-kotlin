Based on the observation, we can come up with a 2-pointers O(n) solution by adding up all operation counts until i==j. To make it better, we can observe the operation counts in the loop. They are arithmetic sequence [0/1, 3, 5, 7,...,n-1]. Note the first number should be either 0 (if n is odd, the middle number doesn't change) or 1 (if n is even).\n"},"976":{"id":976,"level":"EASY","link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-perimeter-triangle/","rating":1340,"hint":null},"337":{"id":337,"level":"MEDIUM","link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iii/","rating":0,"hint":null},"84":{"id":84,"level":"HARD","link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/","rating":0,"hint":"monotonous stack, increasing"},"981":{"id":981,"level":"MEDIUM","link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/time-based-key-value-store/","rating":1574,"hint":null},"2454":{"id":2454,"level":"HARD","link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-iv/","rating":2175,"hint":"stack"},"1239":{"id":1239,"level":"MEDIUM","link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-a-concatenated-string-with-unique-characters/","rating":1719,"hint":null},"1047":{"id":1047,"level":"EASY","link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string/","rating":1286,"hint":"stack, O(n)"},"343":{"id":343,"level":"MEDIUM","link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-break/","rating":0,"hint":null},"279":{"id":279,"level":"MEDIUM","link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-squares/","rating":0,"hint":null},"345":{"id":345,"level":"EASY","link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-vowels-of-a-string/","rating":0,"hint":null},"26":{"id":26,"level":"EASY","link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/","rating":0,"hint":null},"223":{"id":223,"level":"MEDIUM","link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-area/","rating":0,"hint":"interval overlapping problem"},"351":{"id":351,"level":"MEDIUM","link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/android-unlock-patterns/","rating":0,"hint":null},"353":{"id":353,"level":"MEDIUM","link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/design-snake-game/","rating":0,"hint":null},"38":{"id":38,"level":"MEDIUM","link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/","rating":0,"hint":null},"41":{"id":41,"level":"HARD","link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/","rating":0,"hint":"use sign as flag for existence without losing original positive integer information"},"1706":{"id":1706,"level":"MEDIUM","link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/where-will-the-ball-fall/","rating":1764,"hint":null},"42":{"id":42,"level":"HARD","link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/","rating":0,"hint":"monotonous stack (decreasing), similar to question 84 (https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/)"},"1323":{"id":1323,"level":"EASY","link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-69-number/","rating":1193,"hint":null},"1003":{"id":1003,"level":"MEDIUM","link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-word-is-valid-after-substitutions/","rating":1426,"hint":"stack for O(n)"},"2095":{"id":2095,"level":"MEDIUM","link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-the-middle-node-of-a-linked-list/","rating":1324,"hint":null},"1328":{"id":1328,"level":"MEDIUM","link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/break-a-palindrome/","rating":1473,"hint":null},"433":{"id":433,"level":"MEDIUM","link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-genetic-mutation/","rating":0,"hint":null},"49":{"id":49,"level":"MEDIUM","link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/","rating":0,"hint":null},"1201":{"id":1201,"level":"MEDIUM","link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/ugly-number-iii/","rating":2039,"hint":"lcm, gcd, binary-search.
